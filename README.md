# Dataview-Deep-Dive
 An Obsidian Vault for Dataview and Later Datacore Examples
To be able to use this vault you need to download the repo and open it with Obsidian. 
Then you need to activate the Community plugins and enable all plugins in the list. I try to keep only the necessary ones.
Then have fun browsing through the notes and queries. Start in the Vault.md note for an explanation and links to interesting notes.
