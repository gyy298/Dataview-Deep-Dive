# Dataview-Deep-Dive

An Obsidian Vault for Dataview and later Datacore examples.
- To be able to use this vault you need to download the repo and open it with Obsidian. 
- Then you need to activate the Community plugins and enable all plugins in the list. I try to keep only the necessary ones.
- Then have fun browsing through the notes and queries. Start in the Vault.md note for an explanation and links to interesting notes.
- if you have questions or want help with dataview then join obsidians Discord server. you can find me inside the Dataview channel.
- I'm aware that most of the notes are incomplete and or in the wrong format. the notes inside the Discord Support folder are the old setup i had for keeping the dataview notes but it didn't work. i still need to extract the queries and slowly delete the notes.
