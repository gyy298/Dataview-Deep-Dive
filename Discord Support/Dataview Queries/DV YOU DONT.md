## YOU DONT DO THAT

- Whatever you want to do, DON'T do it.
- think about how you can break up your Query or Goal into smaller steps
- rethink your metadata and how you would need to change it to make the query easier to do
- if it is doable, then DO THAT 
- adjusting metadata is easier than writing a 300 line DVJS query that could be a 6 line DQL query with the right metadata setup.
