## Log

- today i created a heatmap of these logs inside [[Vault]] and the daily note logs will now be used as broad changelog
- i also wrote the [[ThreeInTen Analysis]] note and added 2 queries
- i thought about how and in what style i want to write the note content inside the notes besides the queries. 
- I'm not sure yet on how i will do it
